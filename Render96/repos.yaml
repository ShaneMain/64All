      description: "Render96 is a free-to-play fan modification for Super Mario 64. The goal of this project is to match the promotional artwork used for the game during the late 1990's. Every model and asset was 100% recreated using images found online from the Nintendo 64 era. The Render96 team does not condone the use of piracy or any other illegal action that may directly harm Nintendo or its intellectual properties."

    info:
      description: "This is a fork of the sm64-port project, featuring enhanced functionalities including a customizable options menu, external data loading for textures and soundbanks, and support for various rendering modes like OpenGL1.3 and D3D12. It allows for button remapping, optional camera controls, and fixes for models and textures. Users can skip certain cutscenes, access a cheats menu, and handle save files in both little-endian and big-endian formats. Recent updates have changed the default save and configuration file paths, which can be customized via the CLI."
